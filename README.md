# tomatoBrowser
tomatoBrowser's official GitHub page!


## Overview
tomatoBrowser is a hobby project, so do not use it as your main browser. It is currently in its alpha developement, and right now bug fixes will come fast. If you find a bug (or crash), please report it in the issues section.


## Instllaing
Installation is simple, just go to the [realeases area](https://github.com/PhilipSolo1/tomatoBrowser/releases) or the [tomatoBrowser Downloads at PASWS.net](http://pasws.net/projects/tomatoBrowser/downloads/) (not yet ready) and download the latest release avaliable.

### Requirements
 - Python
 - PyQt5
 - PyQtWebEngine (PyQt5 version)

### Bundled releases
Bundled releases are avaliable, but are still experimental, so they can be unstable. Download them from the ["Bundled" tag in the realeses area](https://github.com/PhilipSolo1/tomatoBrowser/releases/tag/Bundled).

### Installer
I'm currently working on another porject a GUI-based installer in Python, which I will utilize here. Until now, releases with a installer are unavaliable due to issues with packaging.


## Versions/releases and how they work

### How they work
There are two of them: Version and Releases. You download releases, and you use versions.

#### Realeases
Realeases are the verions that you can download.

#### Versions
Versions are the ones I develop. If I do not have enough time to release the version I just made, it will be private, and I will go on to create the next version. They also have a naming system: VERSION_X.X.X_YYYYY_ZZZZZZZ_AA. X.X.X is the version, for example 1.0.0. YYYYY is the version channel. It can be alpha, beta, or stable. ZZZZZZZ is the publicity. It can be PRIVATE or PUBLIC. AA is the build number. It is written in this format: if the build is single-digit, it would begin with zero. Otherwise it will just be the number.
